**Iris Flower Classification Model**


**Overview**

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in pattern recognition, is utilized for training and testing the model.

**Dataset**

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.

**Installation**

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

**NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn**


**Model Evaluation**

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These metrics provide insight into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

**Contributing**
